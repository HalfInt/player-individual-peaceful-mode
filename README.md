## Description
This datapack allows players to play on a non-peaceful world or server, while not having to deal with monsters. Mode is set on a per-player basis by giving them the "PeacefulPlayer" tag. Monsters getting to close to a player on Individual Peaceful Mode will vanish. Monsters can be made exempt and will stay around, e.g. if they have been intentionally captured and put to use. If monsters happened to have picked up items, they will not vanish but instead die on the spot, dropping said items.

### Intend
- Allows players (e.g. younger children) not (yet) up for the challenge of fighting or evading monsters to play with others preferring higher difficulty.
- In contrast to the build-in peaceful mode, players still get the experience of having to deal with the food and health-regeneration system and can eat at all.
- In contrast to setting players to creative mode (which makes monsters ignore them), they still get the experience of dealing with resource management.

### Drawbacks / Shortcomings:
- Players in Individual Peaceful Mode can still see monsters in the distance.
- Players in Individual Peaceful Mode can still anger Enderman by looking at them. However, the Enderman will vanish as it gets close.
- Zombies can start tracking players from far away. They will try to move towards them, but vanish as they get close to a player in Individual Peaceful Mode.

- Currently, only monsters normally present in the Overworld are covered by this datapack. Players in Individual Peaceful Mode are supposed to neither go to the Nether (unless it has been prepared to be safe), nor to the End while the Enderdragon is around.
- The rare, nonrenewable Elder Guardian is exempt and will stay around. As it is easy to avoid, players in Individual Peaceful Mode are expected to not go near them.
